连锁酒店85GB的安全日志暴露于公网

近日，研究人员发现了一个公开的数据库，内容包含了万豪在内的众多连锁酒店的安全日志，其中还包括潜在的安全漏洞。

该团队于2019年5月27日发现故障服务器，经过检测发现该服务器连接了酒店和度假村管理公司Pyramid Hotel Group，该公司是美国、夏威夷、英国、爱尔兰等地包括万豪、喜来登、希尔顿等19个酒店及物业的管理方。

故障服务器可通过9200端口关联到Elasticsearch数据库，并可不受限制的访问由开源入侵检测系统Wazuh生成的安全审计日志。该数据库的暴露直接公开了酒店的大量敏感数据，虽然数据库中每个记录都没有明确的名称，但Tarrytown House Estate、Carton House Luxury Hotel、Aloft Hltels、Temple Bar Hotel这些关键词都是可以直接识别的。据统计，暴露的安全审计日志内容一共达到了85.4GB。

 Snapchat

In January 2014 just one week after Gibson Security detailed vulnerabilities in the service, Snapchat had 4.6 million usernames and phone number exposed. The attack involved brute force enumeration of a large number of phone numbers against the Snapchat API in what appears to be a response to Snapchat's assertion that such an attack was "theoretical". Consequently, the breach enabled individual usernames (which are often used across other services) to be resolved to phone numbers which users usually wish to keep private.

 Warframe

In November 2014, the online game Warframe was hacked and 819k unique email addresses were exposed. Allegedly due to a SQL injection flaw in Drupal, the attack exposed usernames, email addresses and data in a "pass" column which adheres to the salted SHA12 password hashing pattern used by Drupal 7. Digital Extremes (the developers of Warframe), asserts the salted hashes are of "alias names" rather than passwords.
